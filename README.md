# c_szg
C API for a subset of szg (for easier interfacing w. other environments)

Uses scons to build, I only know that it builds in Aszgard so far. Exposes a whopping 3 functions so far.

Szg headers are included in include/, empty lib/<platform>/ directories into which you should drop the libraries.

Output is in build/<platform>/.
